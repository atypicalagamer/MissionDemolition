Welcome to my Mission Demolition project! Or, as I like to call it, Apple Pelter!

So the first project I did for my Game Design class was Apple Picker in which you moved your mouse around and caught apples falling from a moving apple tree.
You'd start out with 4 baskets, you'd lose one if you caught a purple poison apple, your high score was kept, and overall it was a cute game to create.

Now, as I was creating Mission Demolition for this class, I couldn't help but wonder how this game could be given some meaning or some changes in order to feel a bit more complete.
Well? After a nice call with my mom, I figured out what I could do with this project; make it a sequel to Apple Picker!

Enhancements:
- Colors changed to reflect the "Apple Picker sequel" theme:
  - Material for the slingshot was changed to a more fitting wooden color so 1) it feels like you're actually launching from a real slingshot instead of a toy one, and
    2) the color chosen would probably do better on the eyes for the player.
  - Material for the projectile was adjusted so it appeared more like a shiny, delicious apple. It was also changed to match the theming!
  - Material for the wall and slab blocks were changed to become more like wood because it wouldn't have made much since for thrown apples to move blocks of stone.
  - Background color was changed differently from the color used in the book so it was nicer on the eye.
- Prefab adjustments:
  - Changed the masses of the projectile and castle blocks so the game's destruction factor was still somewhat fun (i.e. made the walls and slabs lighter so the heavier projectiles could really bash into them).
- Added a new Basket visual right next to the slingshot as a tie-in with Apple Picker:
  - The asset itself (color, shape) is ripped directly from Apple Picker.
  - I even gave the basket some apples so it looks you just came from playing Apple Picker and got yourself some apples to throw at the structures!
- "Game Over" screen enhanced/upgraded from Apple Picker:
  - The ground asset and background color from the game scene is carried over into the "You Win!!" screen to prevent any jarring background switches.
  - Projectiles and blocks were scattered along the ground of the "You Win!!" screen so the theming stayed consisting and the player could gain further accomplishment from their destruction.

With all these enhancements put together, I am much happier with this project compared to how I felt afater making Apple Picker, and I'll definitely be adding more enhancements for the next project! :]
